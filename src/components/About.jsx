      <span className='italic text-2xl'> Cas-Tech Glue,</span> an innovative solution from Beposo, Western Region, is addressing waste management and environmental pollution caused by discarded cassava starch and peels at gari processing factories. The solution involves creating a biodegradable adhesive glue using cassava starch and peels, which serves as an eco-friendly alternative to harmful synthetic adhesives. This approach not only reduces pollution but also adds value to cassava by-products, contributing to sustainable waste management.
